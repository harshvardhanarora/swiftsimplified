Hey there! I'm **Harshvardhan Arora**, a software engineer who loves turning ideas into code. I enjoy building backend systems, experimenting with new technologies, and writing clean, maintainable solutions.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring spicy recipes, trying out international cuisines, or diving into tech blogs. This space is where I share my experiments, tutorials, and thoughts on programming and software development.

Feel free to poke around, learn something new, or just say hi!
