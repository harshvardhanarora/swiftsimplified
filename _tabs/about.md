Hey there! I'm **Harshvardhan Arora**, a Senior iOS Engineer at **Jaguar Land Rover**, currently based in Manchester. I specialize in building robust, scalable, and elegant iOS applications using **Swift**, **SwiftUI**, and **UIKit**, with a strong focus on architecture, performance, and user experience.

Outside of work, I’m passionate about sharing knowledge and insights through my technical blog, where I write about iOS development, Swift tips, and engineering best practices.

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me:
- 🕹️ Battling it out in **Dota 2** (Invoker main!)
- 🏎️ Watching **Formula 1** — huge fan of **Max Verstappen**
- 🏁 Hitting the track for some **go-karting** whenever I get the chance

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to connect or reach out if you share similar interests or just want to talk tech, games, or racing.
